# CS-215-Project-1

The goal of this project was to create a gas station program that used customers reward points to discount gas prices. 
The gas station is called "Not Your Mother's Gas Station."

The program goes like this: 

1.) First welcome a customer to the gas station, with the brand name displayed. 
2.) Ask the customer if they're a rewards customer. 
3.) If they're a rewards customer: 
     - Caluclate how many rewards points they have. 
     - Decide if they get a discount on the gas price, if they have enough points. 
4.) If they're not a rewards customer: 
     - Tell the customer to ask the attendant on becoming one. 
     
5.) Display the gas prices (with discount, if available). 
6.) Ask what level of octane they want. 
7.) Ask for the amount of gallons of gas they want. 
8.) Calculate and print the price. 
9.) Calculate new amount of reward points, if they're a customer. 
10.) Print a receipt.
